# Simpsons_Faces_Generation_using_VAEs
## "Simpsons faces generation using VAEs involves training a VAE model on a dataset of Simpsons character faces. The VAE consists of an encoder network that learns a low-dimensional representation of the input faces and a decoder network that reconstructs the faces from the latent space. By training the VAE on Simpsons face images, it learns to capture the underlying structure and variability of the characters' facial features. The trained VAE can then generate new Simpsons face samples by sampling from the learned latent space and decoding the samples back into image space. This approach allows for the generation of diverse and realistic Simpsons character faces, enabling creative applications in various domains.
